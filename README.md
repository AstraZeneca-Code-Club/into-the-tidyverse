## Help

### Importing Datasets

To import a dataset from this repository, you will first need to download it. You can do this by clicking on one of the data links above. Then select the file of interest. You should then be taken to a page showing a preview of the file. Select `raw` from the top menu. This will open a pure text version of the file. Right-click or use `crtl-S` to save the file to someone on your hard drive.

You can then import this into R by setting your working directory to either the folder containing the file or a directory containing it and then specifying the correct relative path. 

If you are use RStudio cloud, you will need to open the `Files` panel and select `upload` to add the file to your workspace.
