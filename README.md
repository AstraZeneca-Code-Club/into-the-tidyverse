# An Introduction to the Tidyverse

## About This Repository

This repository contains slides, exercise sheets, and solution sheets for my course, 'An Introduction to the Tidyverse'. This was first taught at Alsager Sixth Form during the Autumn term of 2019 and has since been adapted for use at the Macclesfield AstraZeneca coding network. This repository is twinned with [this other repository](https://github.com/THargreaves/edexcel-large-dataset-extractor) which contains a script to extract and clean the contents of the Edexcel large dataset into CSV files as well as the output of running said script. The repository is designed to be completely self-contained, with any images and data used in the presentations or exercises included in each session's data folder. You can use the navigation links below to find relevant resources and below that a few words of guidance can be found.

## About the Course

'An Introduction to the Tidyverse' does exactly what it says on the tin. This is an intensive 5-week course which aims to take someone from a coding-zero to tidyverse-hero in as little time as possible. Each session is composed of a rapid-fire presentation introducing different elements of the tidyverse as well as an exercise sheet to help consolidate the ideas presented in the slideshow.

For more information on the structure and contents of this course, please take a look at the following [introductory presentation](https://github.com/THargreaves/introtothetidyverse/blob/master/An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20tidyverse%20-%20Course%20Summary.pptx).

The contents of presentation are designed to be dense so don't worry if everything seems a bit intimidating. It takes far too long to memorise the exact function calls and parameter names of a new programming language and so I don't make any attempt to teach this. Instead, the goal of this course is to have a scan through the tidyverse landscape and point out some of the key landmarks. Since the contents of the presentations are so dense, then all you need to do is remember where to find those landmarks and look up the specifics of what you are trying to do as you go. This is often how real junior programmers work and you shouldn't be ashamed of doing so too; in fact I'd argue that it is one of the best ways to learn.

My main word of guidance is 'practice'. Practice, practice, practice. You can read through these slides as many times as your heart disires and it is likely most of it will soon be forgotten. Instead, scan through the presentations so you know what tools are available and where to find them and then get straight onto the exercise sheets. If you reach a hurdle, have a look back through the slides. Wash, rinse, repeat and soon you'll by a tidyverse star!

## Help

### Importing Datasets

To import a dataset from this repository, you will first need to download it. You can do this by clicking on one of the data links above. Then select the file of interest. You should then be taken to a page showing a preview of the file. Select `raw` from the top menu. This will open a pure text version of the file. Right-click or use `crtl-S` to save the file to someone on your hard drive.

You can then import this into R by setting your working directory to either the folder containing the file or a directory containing it and then specifying the correct relative path. 

If you are use RStudio cloud, you will need to open the `Files` panel and select `upload` to add the file to your workspace.
